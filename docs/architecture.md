# Phase 0 architecture

Browser -> 127.0.0.1:8765 -> API container port 8000 (Uvicorn/FastAPI) -> postgres:5432 (PostgreSQL container).

- GET /health checks API responsiveness.
- GET /health/db executes SELECT 1 using Psycopg, with bounded connection/query timeouts.
- Compose starts the API after PostgreSQL passes its healthcheck; API healthcheck queries /health/db.
- PostgreSQL data persists in the existing named volume.
- Credentials are injected at runtime from the ignored local .env; no secrets are copied into the image.
- API runs as a non-root user. Only localhost ports are published.

No LLM, RAG or Agent functionality is implemented.
